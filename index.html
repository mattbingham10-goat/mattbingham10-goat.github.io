            <p>Hi, my name is Matthew Bingham, I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student. 
                I like video games, hanging out with my friends, watching movies, and occasionally reading books. In the midst of my first time
                abroad in a foreign country I came to realize that I love to travel, and want to continue this trend and continue traveling. In addition, my time
                so far in Japan has made me realize how much more we can do about waste and saving our planet, it has made me realize just how much garbage
                we dump back into the Earth daily just for convience. I hope to create a memorable project and memories that will last a lifetime during this trip. Feel 
                free to come up to me for a photo anytime. 
            </p>
